The medical name of heart attack is “Myocardial infarction”.
Heart attack in short; It is the occlusion of the vessel by plaque-like lesions filled with cholesterol and fat.
The lesion is called abnormal conditions that occur in the organs where the disease is located.
As a result of the blockage, the blood flow is completely cut off and a heart attack that can lead to death occurs.
How does a heart attack occur?

The heart is a powerful pump that pumps blood throughout the body 60-80 times per minute at rest.
While meeting the blood needs of the whole body, it also needs to be fed and taken blood.
These vessels that feed the heart itself are called coronary arteries.
Coronary insufficiency occurs when there is a disruption in the circulation of the coronary arteries.
The cases of coronary insufficiency vary according to the type, degree and location of the stenosis in the coronary vessels.
While some patients may have chest pain that occurs only during physical activity and is relieved by rest, sometimes a heart attack may occur as a result of sudden occlusion of the vessels, starting with severe chest pain and leading to sudden death.

 Recognizing Variables In Dataset
 age - age in years
sex - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0 = asymptomatic)
trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 0 = hypertrophy)
thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (2 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 0 = downsloping)
ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal - 2 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect
num - the predicted attribute - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Value 0 = < diameter narrowing; Value 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
